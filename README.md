A collection of MIT-licensed single-file libraries for C and C++.

* Color space interpolator (linear RGB, HSL, HSV, CIELAB, CIELCh, and more): [tf_color_space.h](https://github.com/twelvefifteen/tf/blob/master/tf_color_space.h)
* Image statistics (histograms, comparison, mean, mode): 
* Image transformation (resize, rotate): [tf_image_transform.h](https://github.com/twelvefifteen/tf/blob/master/tf_image_transform.h)

All libraries have been tested with C and C++ using MSVC++ 14.21 and Apple LLVM version 10.0.1.
