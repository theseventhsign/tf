* Image statistics (histograms, comparison, mean, mode): [tf_image_statistics.h](https://github.com/twelvefifteen/tf/blob/master/tf_image_statistics.h)
* Image transformation (resize, rotate): [tf_image_transform.h](https://github.com/twelvefifteen/tf/blob/master/tf_image_transform.h)

All libraries are under the MIT license. They have been tested with C and C++ using MSVC++ 14.21 and Apple LLVM version 10.0.1.
